## Folder Structure

The frontend codebase follows a structured layout to maintain scalability and organization. Here's a brief overview:

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/pages`: Higher-level components representing different views.
- `src/styles`: CSS files or stylesheets for styling components and pages.
- `src/assets`: Static assets like images, fonts, or icons.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **react-router-dom**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for AJAX requests.
- **react-three-fiber**: React renderer for Three.js integration.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
- **@react-three/drei**: Collection of useful Three.js components and hooks for React.

## Routing

Verbify utilizes React Router for navigation between different views or pages within the application. Routes are defined using `<Route>` components, each corresponding to a specific URL path.

## Styling

Styling in Verbify is accomplished with a combination of CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components and CSS preprocessors like SASS. Additionally, Three.js is used for 3D graphics styling. This allows for encapsulation of styles within components and easier maintenance.

## Testing

Unit and integration testing are performed using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and functionality of components and features.

## Deployment

Verbify frontend is deployed using platforms like Vercel or Netlify, with CI/CD pipelines set up for automated deployment and delivery of updates to production environments.
